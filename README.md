# Welcome

This is a simulator for a Hall effect digital chessboard. It injects faults into the micocontroller for the chessboard by simulating the analog readings of the Hall effect sensors through a dac.

This uses ciruit python.

There are a few relevant files. Mainly, the code.py is the main code file that is put onto the board.

# Testing board / serial connection

Commands needed to connect to the device

to find device (probably AM0, AM1, ...)
ls /dev/tty*

to connect to the board through serial usb
screen /dev/ttyACM4 115200

This should then recieve anything sent with print()
REPL can also be entered to quickly test code snipets like normal python REPL
Crtl+D reloads it
