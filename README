# Welcome

This is a simulator for a Hall effect digital chessboard. It injects faults into the micocontroller for the chessboard by simulating the analog readings of the Hall effect sensors through a dac.

This uses ciruit python.

There are a few relevant files. Mainly, the code.py is the main code file that is put onto the board.
